            I'm Moskas, a hobbyist computer programmer from Poland. The website has
            no particular topic other than being mostly tech related. It's mainly a
            place for me to write some thoughts or list my programming or rhythm
            game projects.
        </p>
        <h1>Featured projects</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Moskas/mpd-notify-rs">mpd notification daemon</a>
            - Simple notification daemon for mpd, it fetches metadata: album,
            artist, title and cover of the album and sends a notification about
            status, song changes etc. Works across all platforms that are supported
            by Rust and mpd.

            application written in Python that scrapes YouTube channel/playlist and
            plays random video from given channel/playlist. As name implies it's for
            "vibing" so it's for background noise while you work or relax.
