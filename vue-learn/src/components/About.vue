    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I'm Moskas, a hobbyist programmer based in Poland. My passion for technology fuels
      my journey. I'm a proud Linux user and advocate for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). My
      expertise spans Rust, Python, and Bash, with a strong commitment to expanding my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not immersed in code, I'm delving into manga and anime. Currently, I'm deepening my
      proficiency in Rust, Nix and Python.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Moskas/mpd-notify-rs">mpd notification daemon</a>
      - Simple notification daemon for mpd, it fetches metadata: album, artist, title and cover of
      the album and sends a notification about status, song changes etc. Works across all platforms
      that are supported by Rust and mpd.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Moskas/vibepy">vibepy</a> - Small cli application written in
      Python that scrapes YouTube channel/playlist and plays random video from given
      channel/playlist. As name implies it's for "vibing" so it's for background noise while you
      work or relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Moskas/wh-dl">wh-dl</a> - Cli application written in Rust for

      <a href="https://github.com/Moskas/nixos-config">Nixos configs</a> - Not exacly a programming
      project, more of a DevOps one. List of configurations for systems and services written in Nix
      programming language for reproducable installs and development enviroments across all my
      devices. Even this site has some nix in it!
